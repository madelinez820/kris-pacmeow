# Customized Pacman for Kris
 
Happy Birthday <3 
 
I played around with this repo (https://github.com/SteveDunn/Pacman) to create this (and so I could start figuring out how to use TypeScript 😂). Обичам теб много сега и завинаги.

## To run on dev
- ```npm install -g typescript```
- ```tsc```
- ```cd dist```
- ```npm start```
- play it on ```http://localhost:8080/```
