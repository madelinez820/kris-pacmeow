- Thank you to https://github.com/SteveDunn/Pacman - most of the game logic and framework / main assets are from here; kris-pacmeow largely consists of code from Steve's repo (I added custom assets and made code / logic changes here and there). I tried to fork this originally but ended up creating a new repo instead (kris-pacmeow was private during development to maintain the element of birthday surprise, and I couldn't figure out how to create a private fork of a public repo)
- Most of the custom sprites / images were created by me, but insertcoin.PNG was made by https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik from www.flaticon.com
