Thank you to https://github.com/SteveDunn/Pacman - the main game logic and framework / main assets are from here, I added some custom assets and made slight code / logitc changes.
Most of the custom sprites / images were created by me, but insertcoin.PNG was made by https://www.flaticon.com/authors/freepik from www.flaticon.com
